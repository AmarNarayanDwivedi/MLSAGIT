## 6. Creating an HTML File Template with "!" (Emmet)

In Visual Studio Code, you can use the Emmet abbreviation `!` to quickly generate an HTML5 boilerplate template.

### Steps:
1. Open VS Code and create a new file (`Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N` on macOS).
2. Type `!` in the file.
3. Press `Tab` (or `Enter` in some setups) to expand it into a full HTML5 template.

### Example Template Generated by Emmet:
 ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
 ```

### Adding Classes and IDs:
Once you have the HTML template, you can quickly add **classes** and **IDs** to HTML elements. Here's how they are used:

- **Classes** are used to apply the same style to multiple elements.
- **IDs** are unique and can be used to identify specific elements for styling or scripting.

#### Example with Classes and IDs:
```html
<div class="container" id="main-content">
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph inside a container.</p>
</div>
```
### 7: Working with Classes and IDs, and Using Multicursors

### Creating and Using Classes & IDs in HTML:
- **Classes**: Use classes to apply styles to multiple elements. A class can be shared by many elements in the HTML.
- **IDs**: Use IDs for unique identification of an element. IDs must be unique within the page and are commonly used for styling specific elements or selecting elements in JavaScript.

#### Example with Classes and IDs:
```html
<div class="container">
    <h1 class="heading">Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p class="description">This is a sample paragraph inside a container.</p>
</div>
```
 ## 8: Live Server Extension and Themes

### Install Live Server Extension:
1. Open the Extensions Marketplace by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
2. In the search bar, type **Live Server**.
3. Click **Install** on the Live Server extension to add it to your VS Code setup.

### Launch Live Preview:
- After the installation, you can launch a live preview of your HTML file by:
  1. Right-click on an HTML file in your workspace.
  2. Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
- This will open the HTML file in your default browser, automatically refreshing the page whenever you make changes to the file.

### Themes and Material Icon Extensions:

1. **Material Theme**: 
   - A popular, sleek, and modern theme for a clean and visually appealing interface.
   - To install, search for "Material Theme" in the Extensions Marketplace and click **Install**.

2. **Material Icon Theme**:
   - Adds Material Design-inspired icons to the file explorer for better organization and a more intuitive workspace.
   - To install, search for "Material Icon Theme" in the Extensions Marketplace and click **Install**.

Both extensions can be easily installed from the Extensions Marketplace for a personalized and enhanced editor experience.
